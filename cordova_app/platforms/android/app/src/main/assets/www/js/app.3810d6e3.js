Not having gone 是現在完成式的形式，也使用了過去分詞形式，但是這裡不合適，因為現在完成式強調的是一個動作或狀態對現在的影響或重要性，但是這個句子中並不需要強調這個意思。選項 (C) Not gone 是過去分詞的形式，正確地表達了缺少了動作所帶來的結果，因此是正確的選項。選項 (D) Having not gone 是現在完成式的形式，使用了現在完成式和過去分詞形式，但是和選項

Rising temperatures can lead to extreme weather events such as hurricanes, floods, and droughts, which in turn can cause significant damage to infrastructure, property, and crops. Melting ice caps and rising sea levels can lead to the displacement of communities living in low-lying coastal areas.

In fact, studies have shown that more than one-third of American adults do not get the recommended seven hours of sleep each night.Lack of sleep can have a variety of negative effects on both our physical and mental health. For example, it can increase the risk of developing chronic health conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. It can also impair our immune system, making us more susceptible to illnesses.In addition to these physical health effects, lack of sleep can also affect our mental health. It can lead to problems with mood regulation, making us more irritable, anxious, and depressed. It can also impair cognitive function, making it harder to concentrate, learn, and remember things.So how can we improve our sleep habits? Here are some tips:Stick to a regular sleep schedule. Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends.Create a relaxing sleep environment. Keep your bedroom dark, quiet, and cool, and avoid using electronic devices before bed.Avoid caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol before bedtime, as they can disrupt your sleep.Get regular exercise, but avoid exercising too close to bedtime.If you have trouble sleeping, try relaxation techniques such as deep breathing or meditation, or consider talking to a healthcare professional about sleep aids.",q:["What is the main idea of the passage?","According to the passage, what are some physical health effects of lack of sleep?","What is the author's advice for creating a relaxing sleep environment?","According to the passage, what is one potential consequence of impaired cognitive function due to lack of sleep?","What is the author's advice for improving sleep habits?"],q_sel:[[" Lack of sleep can have negative effects on physical health."," Lack of sleep can have negative effects on mental health."," Lack of sleep is a problem for many Americans."," Getting a good night's sleep is important."],[" Increased risk of developing depression."," Impaired cognitive function."," Increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease."," Difficulty concentrating."],[" Use electronic devices before bed."," Keep the bedroom warm and bright."," Avoid noise in the bedroom."," Keep the bedroom cool and dark."],[" Increased risk of developing obesity."," Difficulty concentrating and learning."," Higher susceptibility to illnesses."," Problems with mood regulation."],[" Drink alcohol before bedtime."," Exercise right before going to bed."," Stick to a regular sleep schedule."," Use electronic devices in bed."]],q_ex:["文章一開始就提到了睡眠的重要性，後面的內容也在強調睡眠的好處以及如何改善睡眠習慣。因此，答案為D。","文章提到，缺乏睡眠可以增加患上慢性疾病（例如肥胖症、糖尿病和心血管疾病）的風險。因此，答案為C。","文章提到了創建一個放鬆的睡眠環境的建議，其中包括保持臥室涼爽、黑暗以及避免在睡前使用電子設備。因此，答案為D。","文章提到了缺乏睡眠對認知功能的影響，可能會讓人難以集中注意力、學習和記憶。因此，答案為B。","文章提到了改善睡眠習慣的建議，其中包括保持規律的睡眠時間表，晚上睡前避免飲用咖啡因、尼古丁和酒精，以及避免在睡前使用電子設備。因此，答案為C。"],q_a:[" D"," C"," D"," B"," C"],zh:"睡眠的重要性我們都知道睡個好覺很重要，但我們中的許多人仍然沒有定期獲得足夠的睡眠。事實上，研究表明，超過三分之一的美國成年人每晚沒有達到建議的七小時睡眠時間。睡眠不足會對我們的身心健康產生各種負面影響。例如，它會增加患肥胖症、糖尿病和心血管疾病等慢性疾病的風險。它還會損害我們的免疫系統，使我們更容易生病。除了這些身體健康影響外，睡眠不足還會影響我們的心理健康。它會導致情緒調節問題，使我們更加易怒、焦慮和抑鬱。它還會損害認知功能，使注意力、學習和記憶變得更加困難。那麼我們如何改善睡眠習慣呢？這裡有一些提示： 堅持規律的睡眠時間表。每天在同一時間睡覺和起床，週末也不例外。營造輕鬆的睡眠環境。保持臥室黑暗、安靜和涼爽，睡前避免使用電子設備。睡前避免咖啡因、尼古丁和酒精，因為它們會擾亂您的睡眠。定期鍛煉，但避免在臨睡前鍛煉。如果您有睡眠困難，嘗試放鬆技巧，如深呼吸或冥想，或考慮與醫療保健專業人員討論助眠劑。"},{ar:"In recent years, there has been a growing interest in plant-based diets.

Plant-based diets have also been shown to be effective for weight loss and improving overall health.However, some people worry that plant-based diets might not provide all of the necessary nutrients, especially for people who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or have certain health conditions. For example, plant-based diets may not provide enough protein, calcium, or vitamin B12.Another concern is that some plant-based foods, such as soy and nuts, can be allergenic and cause reactions in some people. Additionally, some plant-based diets may not be sustainable in the long-term due to the large amounts of water and other resources needed to produce certain crops.Overall, plant-based diets can be a healthy and sustainable choice for many people.

Climate change refers to the long-term changes in Earth's climate, including changes in temperature, precipitation, and wind patterns, among others. While natural factors such as volcanic activity and solar radiation can contribute to climate change, the overwhelming scientific consensus is that human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, are the primary cause of the current trend.The consequences of climate change are vast and far-reaching. Rising temperatures can lead to extreme weather events such as hurricanes, floods, and droughts, which in turn can cause significant damage to infrastructure, property, and crops. Melting ice caps and rising sea levels can lead to the displacement of communities living in low-lying coastal areas.

For example, it can increase the risk of developing chronic health conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. It can also impair our immune system, making us more susceptible to illnesses.In addition to these physical health effects, lack of sleep can also affect our mental health. It can lead to problems with mood regulation, making us more irritable, anxious, and depressed. It can also impair cognitive function, making it harder to concentrate, learn, and remember things.So how can we improve our sleep habits? Here are some tips:Stick to a regular sleep schedule. Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends.Create a relaxing sleep environment. Keep your bedroom dark, quiet, and cool, and avoid using electronic devices before bed.Avoid caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol before bedtime, as they can disrupt your sleep.Get regular exercise, but avoid exercising too close to bedtime.If you have trouble sleeping, try relaxation techniques such as deep breathing or meditation, or consider talking to a healthcare professional about sleep aids.",q:["What is the main idea of the passage?","According to the passage, what are some physical health effects of lack of sleep?","What is the author's advice for creating a relaxing sleep environment?","According to the passage, what is one potential consequence of impaired cognitive function due to lack of sleep?","What is the author's advice for improving sleep habits?"],q_sel:[[" Lack of sleep can have negative effects on physical health."," Lack of sleep can have negative effects on mental health."," Lack of sleep is a problem for many Americans."," Getting a good night's sleep is important."],[" Increased risk of developing depression."," Impaired cognitive function."," Increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease."," Difficulty concentrating."],[" Use electronic devices before bed."," Keep the bedroom warm and bright."," Avoid noise in the bedroom."," Keep the bedroom cool and dark."],[" Increased risk of developing obesity."," Difficulty concentrating and learning."," Higher susceptibility to illnesses."," Problems with mood regulation."],[" Drink alcohol before bedtime."," Exercise right before going to bed."," Stick to a regular sleep schedule."," Use electronic devices in bed."]],q_ex:["文章一開始就提到了睡眠的重要性，後面的內容也在強調睡眠的好處以及如何改善睡眠習慣。因此，答案為D。","文章提到，缺乏睡眠可以增加患上慢性疾病（例如肥胖症、糖尿病和心血管疾病）的風險。因此，答案為C。","文章提到了創建一個放鬆的睡眠環境的建議，其中包括保持臥室涼爽、黑暗以及避免在睡前使用電子設備。因此，答案為D。","文章提到了缺乏睡眠對認知功能的影響，可能會讓人難以集中注意力、學習和記憶。因此，答案為B。","文章提到了改善睡眠習慣的建議，其中包括保持規律的睡眠時間表，晚上睡前避免飲用咖啡因、尼古丁和酒精，以及避免在睡前使用電子設備。因此，答案為C。"],q_a:[" D"," C"," D"," B"," C"],zh:"睡眠的重要性我們都知道睡個好覺很重要，但我們中的許多人仍然沒有定期獲得足夠的睡眠。事實上，研究表明，超過三分之一的美國成年人每晚沒有達到建議的七小時睡眠時間。睡眠不足會對我們的身心健康產生各種負面影響。例如，它會增加患肥胖症、糖尿病和心血管疾病等慢性疾病的風險。它還會損害我們的免疫系統，使我們更容易生病。除了這些身體健康影響外，睡眠不足還會影響我們的心理健康。它會導致情緒調節問題，使我們更加易怒、焦慮和抑鬱。它還會損害認知功能，使注意力、學習和記憶變得更加困難。那麼我們如何改善睡眠習慣呢？這裡有一些提示： 堅持規律的睡眠時間表。每天在同一時間睡覺和起床，週末也不例外。營造輕鬆的睡眠環境。保持臥室黑暗、安靜和涼爽，睡前避免使用電子設備。睡前避免咖啡因、尼古丁和酒精，因為它們會擾亂您的睡眠。定期鍛煉，但避免在臨睡前鍛煉。如果您有睡眠困難，嘗試放鬆技巧，如深呼吸或冥想，或考慮與醫療保健專業人員討論助眠劑。"},{ar:"It’s a common misconception that introverts are shy, antisocial individuals who don’t enjoy socializing.
