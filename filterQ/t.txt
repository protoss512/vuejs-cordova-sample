Passage:

In recent years, climate change has become an increasingly urgent issue. As global temperatures rise and extreme weather events become more frequent, it is clear that we need to take action to reduce our carbon footprint and prevent further damage to the planet. One solution that has gained popularity in recent years is renewable energy, which comes from sources that are naturally replenished and can be used without depleting finite resources.

Renewable energy sources include solar, wind, and hydro power, as well as geothermal and biomass energy. These sources have many advantages over traditional fossil fuels, such as coal and oil. For example, they produce little to no emissions and are much less harmful to the environment. They also provide a sustainable and reliable source of energy, as they are not subject to the same price fluctuations and supply constraints as fossil fuels.

Despite these advantages, renewable energy sources still face many challenges. For one, they are often more expensive to develop and implement than traditional energy sources. In addition, their effectiveness can be limited by factors such as weather patterns and geographic location. As a result, governments and private companies alike must invest in research and development to make renewable energy more efficient and cost-effective.

Questions:
