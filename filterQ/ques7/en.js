So how can we improve our sleep habits? Here are some tips: Stick to a regular sleep schedule. Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even weekends. Create a relaxing sleeping environment. Keep your bedroom dark, quiet and cool, and avoid electronic devices before bed. Avoid caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol before bed because they can disrupt your sleep. Exercise regularly, but avoid exercising right before bed. If you have trouble sleeping, try relaxation techniques such as deep breathing or meditation, or consider discussing sleep aids with a healthcare professional."

This is because introverts are more sensitive to external stimuli and tend to be more easily overwhelmed by excessive socializing or sensory input.Introverts also tend to be more reflective and introspective than extroverts, and may prefer to spend time alone with their thoughts rather than engaging in constant external stimulation.
